# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this project is to create a clean process of reading, transforming, and loading the data into a SQL database. Wiki_movies_clean_practice.ipynb was used to explore different ways to manipulate, filter, and transform the data, which were refactored and implemented in many different places to create the final transformations.

The files movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv, and wikipedia-movies.json were too large to be added to the resources folder.
