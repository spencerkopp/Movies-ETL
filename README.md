# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this project is to create a clean process of reading, transforming, and loading the data into a SQL database. Wiki_movies_clean_practice.ipynb was used to explore different ways to manipulate, filter, and transform the data, which were refactored and implemented in many different places to create the final transformations.
