# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this project is to create a clean process of reading, transforming, and loading the data into a SQL database. Wiki_movies_clean_practice.ipynb was used to explore different ways to manipulate, filter, and transform the data, which were refactored and implemented in many different places to create the final transformations.

The source of the data for this project include ratings.csv, wikipedia-movies.json, and movies_metadata.csv. Wikipedia-movies.json and movies_metadata.csv can be found in the resources folder, while ratings.csv was too big of a file to upload to GitHub. 

The results of the queries into the created tables can also be found in the resources folder.
